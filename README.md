## Setup
- Extract the following [library](https://github.com/MarcoMartines/GSM-GPRS-GPS-Shield "library") to your arduino/libraries folder.
- Unlock your SIM card's Pin number with a real phone by going to the phone's settings. That way the GSM shield can operate without issues. 
- Make sure that the SIM card is loaded and able to make and receive calls.
